# Encrypted Chat Application

A simple encrypted chat application built with PHP backend and a JavaScript frontend using the Web Crypto API. It supports RSA public key exchange and AES-256 encrypted messaging between two clients.

## Features

- Establish connection between two clients by specifying client IDs.
- RSA key pair generation and secure public key exchange.
- AES-256 key generation and encrypted key exchange.
- Encrypted message sending and receiving using AES-GCM.
- Real-time polling for new messages and keys.
- Clear text and encrypted messaging modes.
- Responsive and modern UI.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Host the PHP files (`send.php`, `poll.php`, `storage.php`, `index.php`) on a PHP-enabled web server (e.g., Apache, XAMPP).
3. Open `index.php` in two different browsers or devices.
4. Enter unique Client IDs and each otherâ€™s Client IDs to connect.
5. Use the buttons to exchange public keys and AES keys.
6. Send plaintext or encrypted messages securely.

## Requirements

- PHP 7+
- Modern web browser with Web Crypto API support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Cryptographic Protocol

- RSA-OAEP with 2048-bit keys for public key encryption.
- AES-GCM with 256-bit keys for message encryption.
- Secure exchange of public keys and AES keys ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

## Notes

- The app uses simple file-based JSON storage for demo purposes.
- Real-time communication is implemented via periodic polling.
- This is a prototype suitable for educational purposes.
